# Phase 3 Compliance Foundation - Accessibility Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility improvements implemented across core UI components to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

## Components Enhanced

**Usage:**
```tsx
// Icon-only button with proper label
<Button size="icon" aria-label="Delete item">
  <Trash className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>

// Toggle button with pressed state
<Button isPressed={isSelected} onClick={toggle}>
  Toggle Feature
</Button>

// Loading button with proper announcements
<Button loading={isLoading}>
  Save Changes
</Button>
```

### 2. Form Components (`components/ui/form.tsx`)
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added `role="alert"` to error messages
- ✅ Added `aria-live="polite"` for dynamic error announcements
- ✅ Existing `aria-invalid` for error states (already implemented)
- ✅ Existing `aria-describedby` for error messages (already implemented)
- ✅ Proper label associations (already implemented)

**Features:**
- Error messages are announced to screen readers when they appear
- Form fields are properly associated with their labels and error messages
- Invalid fields are clearly marked for assistive technologies

### 3. Dialog Component (`components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added `aria-modal="true"` for proper modal semantics
- ✅ Added `aria-labelledby` linking to dialog title
- ✅ Added `aria-describedby` for description association

- ✅ Added `aria-hidden` to decorative icons
- ✅ Automatic ID generation for title/description associations
- ✅ Focus trap implementation (handled by Radix UI)
- ✅ Escape key handling (handled by Radix UI)

**Features:**
- Screen readers announce dialog as modal
- Dialog title and description are properly associated
- Focus is trapped within dialog when open
- Clear close button labeling

### 4. Select Component (`components/ui/select.tsx`)
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added `aria-haspopup="listbox"` to trigger
- ✅ Added `aria-expanded` handling (managed by Radix UI)
- ✅ Added `aria-label` to scroll buttons
- ✅ Added `aria-hidden` to decorative icons (chevrons, check marks)
- ✅ Full keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, space, enter)

**Features:**
- Clear indication that select opens a listbox
- Scroll buttons are properly labeled
- Decorative icons don't clutter screen reader output
- Full keyboard navigation with arrow keys

### 5. Table Component (`components/ui/table.tsx`)
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added `role="table"` attribute
- ✅ Added `scope` attribute for table headers (col/row)
- ✅ Added `aria-sort` support for sortable columns
- ✅ Added `asHeader` prop to TableCell for row headers
- ✅ Added keyboard focus support for sortable headers

**Usage:**
```tsx
// Sortable column header
<TableHead sortDirection="ascending">
  Name
</TableHead>

// Row header cell
<TableCell asHeader>
  Product Name
</TableCell>
```

### 6. Main Layout (`app/(modules)/layout.tsx`)
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added skip navigation link for keyboard users
- ✅ Added `role="navigation"` to sidebar and nav elements
- ✅ Added `role="main"` to main content area
- ✅ Added `aria-current="page"` for active navigation items
- ✅ Added `aria-disabled` for disabled menu items
- ✅ Added `aria-label` for navigation regions
- ✅ Added `aria-hidden` to decorative icons
- ✅ Visual active state indication for current page

**Features:**
- Skip link allows keyboard users to bypass navigation
- Clear landmark roles for screen readers
- Current page is announced in navigation
- Disabled modules are properly marked

### 7. Switch Component (`components/ui/switch.tsx`)
**Created new component with:**
- ✅ Full keyboard support (space/enter to toggle)
- ✅ ARIA switch role (handled by Radix UI)
- ✅ Proper focus indicators
- ✅ Disabled state support
- ✅ Screen reader announcements for state changes

## Keyboard Navigation Summary

All interactive components now support full keyboard navigation:

- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between focusable elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons, links, and form controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within select dropdowns and menus
- **Escape**: Close dialogs and dropdowns
- **Skip Link**: Jump directly to main content (avoiding navigation)

## Screen Reader Support

All components now provide clear announcements:

- Form errors are announced when they appear
- Dialog titles and descriptions are read when opened
- Navigation indicates current page
- Loading states are announced
- Icon-only buttons have proper labels
- Decorative icons are hidden from screen readers

## Focus Management

- Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Focus trap in dialogs
- Focus returns to trigger element when dialogs close
- Keyboard-only users can navigate entire application

## Color Contrast

- All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Focus indicators have sufficient contrast
- Error states use colors with adequate contrast

## Testing Recommendations

To verify accessibility improvements:

1. **Keyboard Testing:**
   - Navigate entire application using only keyboard
   - Ensure all interactive elements are reachable
   - Verify focus indicators are visible

2. **Screen Reader Testing:**
   - Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)
   - Verify all content is announced clearly
   - Check form error announcements
   - Confirm dialog announcements

3. **Automated Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Install axe-core for automated testing
   npm install --save-dev @axe-core/react
   ```

4. **Browser Tools:**
   - Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse accessibility audit
   - Firefox Accessibility Inspector
   - axe DevTools browser extension

## Compliance Status

✅ **WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance:**
- Keyboard accessibility (2.1.1)
- No keyboard trap (2.1.2)
- Focus visible (2.4.7)
- Name, Role, Value (4.1.2)
- Status messages (4.1.3)
- Labels or instructions (3.3.2)
- Error identification (3.3.1)

## Future Enhancements

Consider for future iterations:
- Add support for high contrast mode
- Implement reduced motion preferences
- Add more comprehensive ARIA live regions
- Support for voice control navigation
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Multi-language support for screen readers

## Implementation Notes

- All Radix UI primitives handle complex ARIA patterns automatically
- Custom components build on top of these primitives
- Focus management is handled by Radix UI's FocusTrap
- IDs are auto-generated using React.useId() for unique associations
