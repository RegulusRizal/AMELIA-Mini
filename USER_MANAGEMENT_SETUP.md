# User Management Module Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup

The User Management module has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### 1. Database Schema Created
- **Location**: `/supabase/migrations/001_user_management_schema.sql`
- Complete RBAC system with users, roles, permissions
- Support for employee_id linking to future HR module
- Activity logging for audit trails

### 2. Module Structure
```
lib/modules/user-management/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts       # TypeScript interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas.ts     # Zod validation schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ queries.ts     # Data fetching functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions.ts     # Server actions for mutations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks.ts       # React hooks for client-side
```

### 3. UI Components
- Installed shadcn/ui with all required components
- Created user list page with filtering and pagination
- Added module navigation sidebar

### 4. Pages Created
- `/users` - User management dashboard with stats and user table
- Module layout with sidebar navigation

## üöÄ Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `/supabase/migrations/001_user_management_schema.sql`
4. Copy ALL the content
5. Paste it in the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** to execute the migration

This will create:
- All required tables (profiles, roles, permissions, etc.)
- Row Level Security policies
- Helper functions
- Initial data (user types, modules, default roles)
- **IMPORTANT**: The first user in your database will automatically be assigned the `super_admin` role

### Step 2: Test the User Management Module

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/users
2. You should see the User Management dashboard
3. The first user (you) should have full access

### Step 3: Verify Permissions

Check that your user has been assigned the super_admin role:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > user_roles
2. You should see an entry linking your user_id to the super_admin role

## üìä Module Features

### Current Functionality
- ‚úÖ User list with search and filters
- ‚úÖ User status management (active/inactive/suspended)
- ‚úÖ User type classification (employee, contractor, customer, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Employee ID linking for future HR integration
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control foundation
- ‚úÖ Activity logging
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates support

### Next Steps (Future Implementation)
- [ ] User creation form
- [ ] User edit/detail pages
- [ ] Role assignment interface
- [ ] Permission matrix editor
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Bulk user operations

## üîí Security Notes

1. **RLS Policies**: All tables have Row Level Security enabled
2. **Super Admin**: The first user automatically gets super_admin role
3. **Permission Checks**: The system is ready for permission checks but currently allows access for testing

## üéØ Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Employee ID**: Optional field that links to future HR module
2. **User Types**: Flexible system supporting employees, contractors, customers, etc.
3. **Module Registry**: Future modules can self-register their permissions
4. **Data Redundancy**: Intentional redundancy between User Management and future HR module

## üìù Testing the System

### Create Test Users
You can create test users directly in Supabase:
1. Go to Authentication > Users
2. Click "Invite user"
3. Enter email address
4. User will receive invite email

### Assign Roles
Currently needs to be done via SQL:
```sql
-- Assign a role to a user
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, assigned_by)
SELECT 
  'USER_ID_HERE',
  (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'user_admin'),
  auth.uid()
;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you can't access /users:
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check that the database migration ran successfully
3. Verify your user has the super_admin role in user_roles table

### If tables don't exist:
1. Re-run the migration script
2. Check for errors in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Make sure you're in the correct Supabase project

## üìö Module Documentation

### Permission System
- **Modules**: Define feature areas (user_management, hr, etc.)
- **Roles**: Collections of permissions (super_admin, user_admin, viewer)
- **Permissions**: Granular access controls (module + resource + action)
- **User Roles**: Assignment of roles to users with optional expiration

### Database Functions
- `has_permission(module, resource, action)`: Check if user has specific permission
- `can_access_module(module_name)`: Check if user can access a module
- `get_user_permissions()`: Get all permissions for current user

## ‚ú® Summary

The User Management module is now ready for use! The architecture supports:
- Complete user lifecycle management
- Flexible permission system
- Future module integration
- Employee linkage for HR module
- Audit trails and activity logging

Run the database migration and start managing your users!
